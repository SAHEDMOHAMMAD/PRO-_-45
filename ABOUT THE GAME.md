ðŸ”´Aim of game
Aim of the game is this game can play for everyone childrenâ€™s and adults because this is a nostalgic and traditional game.Before some years the people are playing this game in outside their houses &  grounds etc. But now till they didnâ€™t play this game because now all of the peoples including children are mobile addicts that is why I am making this game in the mobile I think that they will be comfortable to play the game on their mobile because this is the old game they played really.
ðŸ”´CHARACTERS OF THE GAME
Player 1 (real player)
Player 2 ( comp player)
Player 3 (comp player)
Player 4 (comp player)
Player 5 ( comp player) 

ðŸ”´HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
There are five characters in this game the characters are I have mentioned above. We want to play and another all comp characters are automatically play randomly.
We wanted to touch any of the computer characters to really start the game . If we move to any of the computerâ€™s characters on the first time that means the game starts there will be appear a touch switch to touch the comp player after touch the computer player our character wanted run on the ground and reach out from the four comp players when our characters run near through any of the comp characters we will lose & end the game . There was an another thing also that was a tree the player can touch the tree once he can safely stay on 10 seconds without running this is the game.

For what we wanted to add these functions to our game 

ðŸ”´ Add all animations

â€‹       To get a good look for our game 

ðŸ”´Give velocity to all players

â€‹      For chasing our player with computer player that is why we are giving velocity to all players

ðŸ”´Invisible wall needed on 4 sides of the screen 

â€‹      This is an important thing in this game because when we give a velocity to the players the player will go outside the screen so we are making a invisible wall when the player touches the wall at the edges of the screen he will go back another direction 

ðŸ”´Give arrow button to move our player 

â€‹      We need this button on the screen because we are making this as a mobile game.

ðŸ”´Check collider radius 

â€‹     This is an another important thing because when the original player reaches near to the computer player we wanted to stop the game 

ðŸ”´When game starts wanted to show a touch button at first to touch the computer player

â€‹        We need an another button to our players for only one time because this button is to touch another computer players to start the game 

ðŸ”´Add sounds of the birds in small voice 

â€‹       This will attract the players to play the game and we will give the sound of the bird because this is a traditional game 

ðŸ”´Tree function

â€‹       Tree function is used when player wanted to think something player can touch the tree and the tree will protect him for 5 second in twice a game the player has only two chances to touch the tree 

ðŸ”´Make a timer for the game to stop ("3 minutes") 

â€‹        The game is only for 3 minutes because when we extend the time from "3 minutes" i think that will aggressive to play with another 4 computers
